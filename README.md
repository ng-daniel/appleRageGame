# CRUNCHTIME
A frantic grid-based minigame about collecting apples and delaying the inevitable.\
Playable **RIGHT NOW** at https://ingdani.itch.io/crunchtime!!!

## THIS DIRE SITUATION IS ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT.
1. Navigate a grassy field that becomes more difficult the more you mess up. 
2. Keep the clock ticking by collecting magic hourglasses.
3. Crunch n' munch on apples along the way to boost morale (your score).
4. Eating apple cores only spreads appleseeds though, which grow into stumps that block your way.
5. Try not to get the cores mixed up with the hourglass :) :) :)

## HOW IT'S MADE
